This is a week-by-week update for my schizophrenic MRI classification project, done in the Computational Neuroscience and Vision Lab at Boston University. These slides were presented in lab meetings weekly, and highlight results as well as methodology in order to accomplish those results.
I was the sole contributor on this project, coded in MATLAB, which was done from January 2023 - August 2023. 
The goal is to expand on the results of this model by taking new MRI images from a different dataset, which may or may not be in a different
orientation or resulution, in order to assess the generalizability of the model.
